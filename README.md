## Getting started

Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/LeaPhant/pagkibot/wiki) to get help on installing this bot.

## Updating

To update the bot, run `npm run update` in the bot folder. This requires git to be installed, check [here](https://github.com/LeaPhant/pagkibot/wiki/1.-Prerequisites) for instructions.

## Commands

You can find a list of commands [here](https://github.com/LeaPhant/pagkibot/wiki/4.-Commands).

## Limitations

The current limit of the maximum amount of tracked channels is around ~500 per IP address due to Twitch restrictions. This is the reason I can't host this bot and have to let people host it themselves.
