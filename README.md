## Getting started

Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/LeaPhant/pagkibot/wiki) to get help on installing this bot.

## Commands

You can find a list of commands [here](https://github.com/LeaPhant/pagkibot/wiki/4.-Commands).

## Limitations

The current limit of the maximum amount of tracked channels is around ~250 per IP address due to Twitch restrictions. This is the reason I can't host this bot and have to let people host it themselves.

## Why is it called pagkibot?

"pagkibot" is the filipino word for twitch.
