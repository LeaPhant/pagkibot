Discord bot for instant Twitch live notifications using Twitch's PubSub API.

Tracked channels are updated every minute with updated titles, game names and viewcounts.

## Getting started

Head over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/LeaPhant/pagkibot/wiki) to get help on installing this bot.

## Updating

To update the bot, run `npm run update` in the bot folder.

**Warning**: Currently this will delete all files in the bot folder, so store your custom avatar somewhere else if you don't want it to be deleted. The configuration file and the credentials are backed up of course.

## Commands

You can find a list of commands [here](https://github.com/LeaPhant/pagkibot/wiki/4.-Commands).

## Limitations

The current limit of the maximum amount of tracked channels is around ~500 per IP address due to Twitch restrictions. This is the reason I can't host this bot and have to let people host it themselves.

## Why is it called pagkibot?

"pagkibot" is the filipino word for twitch.
